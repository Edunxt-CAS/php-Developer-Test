# Laravel Developer Test Tasks with Examples

## 1. Multi-Role Login System
**Task Example:** Create a school management system login where Admin can access all modules, Teachers can only access student grades and attendance, and Students can only view their own profile and grades. Implement role-based redirects after login and ensure proper authorization middleware prevents unauthorized access.

## 2. Spatie Roles and Permissions CRUD with AJAX
**Task Example:** Build a user management interface where administrators can assign/revoke permissions like "create-posts", "edit-users", "delete-comments" to different roles. Create AJAX-powered modals for editing user roles, dynamic permission checkboxes that update without page reload, and real-time role assignment with instant feedback messages.

## 3. Events and Listeners Implementation
**Task Example:** When a new order is placed in an e-commerce system, trigger an "OrderPlaced" event that automatically: sends confirmation email to customer, updates inventory levels, logs the transaction for analytics, and sends notification to warehouse team. Each action should be handled by separate listeners.

## 4. Jobs and Queue Processing
**Task Example:** Create a bulk email system that processes newsletter sending to 10,000+ subscribers. Implement jobs that send emails in batches of 100, handle failed email deliveries, retry failed jobs with exponential backoff, and provide a dashboard showing job processing status and completion rates.

## 5. Laravel Artisan Commands and Cron Jobs
**Task Example:** Create a command that runs daily at midnight to delete expired user sessions, archive old log files, generate monthly sales reports, and send system health notifications to administrators. Include options for manual execution and dry-run mode for testing.
